        * Added several missing [[nodiscard]]

        * .begin() and .end() are now constexpr for strong::range types. Thanks
          Harald Achitz for reporting the missing specifiers.

        * Added .size() member to strong::range types, if the underlying type
          has a .size() member. Thanks Harald Achitz for the suggestion.

v13 2023-11-29

        * Added static_assert() messages explaining why a modifier cannot be
          used with an underlying type. Thank you SilmaliTech for suggesting
          the improvement.

        * Added modifier `invocable` for types with operator(). Thank you
          Dominic Koepke for the suggestion and the draft implementation.

v12 2023-07-20

        * Fixed a bug where fmt formatter function was not const, as it must be
          per the documentation. Thank you Tim Blechmann for submitting the
          fix.

        * Strong types can be weakly_ordered, strongly_ordered and
          partially_ordered, using operator <=> in C++20 and later. Huge thanks
          to Björn Schäpers and Tim Blechmann for the suggestions, discussions
          and infinite patience.

v11 2023-05-02

        * A strong type can now be used as an NTTP (Non Type Template Parameter)

            using type = strong::type<int, struct int_>;

            template <type t>
            struct S {
                constexpr operator int() const { return value_of(t);}
            };

            int main()
            {
                S<type{3}> obj;
                return obj;
            }

          Thank you Toni Neubert for the implementation.

v10 2023-02-03

        * Corrected the test for, and use of, concepts when specializing
          std::numeric_limits<> for strong::arithmetic types. Thank you
          Björn Schäpers for reporting.

v9 2023-01-23

        * Lowered the minimum required CMake version to 3.7, unless unit-tests
          are built.

        * A type predicate strong::type_is_v<type, modifier> has been introduced.
          It can be used in compile time tests for generic code to ensure that
          a strong type has the necessary modifiers. Example:

          using type = strong::type<int, struct type_,
                                    strong::ordered,
                                    strong::ordered_with<int, long>>;
          static_assert(strong::type_is_v<type, strong::ordered>);
          static_assert(strong::type_is_v<type, strong::ordered_with<long>>);

          Note that for variadic modifiers like strong::ordered_with<>, the
          predicate ensures that all types listed in the test are supported,
          so in the example above, the test type_is_v<type, ordered_with<long>>
          is true because 'long' is included in the type definition using
          ordered_with<int, long>.

          There's also a type version, to use as
          strong::is_type<type, modifier>::value;

        * std::numeric_limits<T> is specialized for types using the
          strong::arithmetic modifier.

        * Added missing const&& overloads for value_of()

v8 2023-01-04

        * Split the header file into one file for each modifier. This can
          in some cases speed up compilation times considerably. The header
          file <strong_type/strong_type.hpp> still includes everything, so
          no changes to existing code is necessary.

        * Added new modifier scalable_with<Ts...>. Allows multiplication and
          division with each of the types Ts. If the underlying type can be
          divided, the result will be the first of the type in Ts.

        * difference types are conditionally ordered, if the underlying type
          supports it. Previously they were always ordered, but e.g. a 2D
          vector on a plane is a useful difference type, but it is usually
          not ordered. This change allows the vector in 2D space to be used
          as a difference type.

        * Add Cmake alias target strong_type::strong_type

        * Use the CMake option -DSTRONG_TYPE_UNIT_TEST=yes to build unit tests

v7 2022-12-22

        * Added missing #include for <fmt/ostream.h>. Thank you Björn Schäpers

        * Fixed MSVC check (typo) for constexpr. Thank you Sergei Soloviev

        * Builds cleanly with -Wconversion

        * Strengthened the unit test suite and CI build structure

v6 2022-10-21

        * Added missing strong::is_ostreamable<> predicate needed for fmtlib 9.
          Thank you Tim Blechman @timblechmann for submitting the fix.

v5 2022-10-20

        * Fixed issue #22, a regression with strong::formattable and fmtlib.
          A type that is strong::ostreamable can be formatted with fmt. A
          type that is both strong::formattable and strong::ostreamable will
          use the type's formatter<> when using fmt. The behaviour of
          std::format is unchanged.

        * strong::arithmetic no longer specializes std::is_arithmetic<>. Issue
          #19. This is expressively disallowed by the standard and is undefined
          behaviour. Sorry for this potentially breaking change, but it was
          always wrong.

v4 2021-08-16

        * strong::affine_point<D> can now be defaulted as
          strong::affine_point<>, in which case a difference type will be
          generated using the same tag as the strong affine point type.

        * operator% is now conditionally supported for arithmetic types,
          provided that the underlying type supports the operation.

        * operator% is also conditionally supported for difference types,
          difference % difference => underlying type, and
          difference % underlying type => difference.

        * strong::difference is now strong::equality comparable in addition
          to being strong::ordered

v3 2021-08-02

        * increment/decrement operators are now hidden friends

        * swap() is now constexpr. Thanks Björn Schäpers @HazardyKnusperkeks

        * operator() is now noexcept if the underlying type has a
          noexcept operator (). Thanks Björn Schäpers @HazardyKnusperkeks

        * Fixed bug where clang++ on Windows wrongly used MSVC work-arounds

        * Fixed bug where non-const operator[] returned const&

        * Use github-actions for CI

v2 2020-07-13

        * Fixed strong::underlying_type<T> for CRTP defined strong type T

        * Added strong::ordered_with<Ts...> for cross-type ordering
          relations.

        * Added strong::equality_with<Ts...> for cross-type equality
          comparison operators.

        * Added strong::unique modifier for creating move-only types

v1 2020-07-11

        * Moved to Boost Software License (BSL) 1.0 license

        * Added convertible_to<Ts...> and implicitly_convertible_to<Ts...>
          modifiers.

        * Added strong::uninitialized for when you *want* to create a
          variable with unitialized value. Unlike the built in types,
          this is explicitly visible at the site of use.

        * Moved many namespace scope functions as inline friends to
          avoid ADL issues.

        * Added strong::semiregular and strong::regular since they are
          such frequently seen good defaults.

        * Many internal improvements and compiler bug work-arounds.

        * Added strong::iterator and strong::range modifiers.

        * More noexcept() specifiers

        * Removed strong::unique and strong::scoped. They are different
          beasts that don't feel quite at home here. Thanks Adi Shavit.
